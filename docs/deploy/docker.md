# Deploy with Docker Compose

Deploy the frontend and backend with a persistent SQLite database. Complete the [quick start](/guide/quick-start) first.

## Select an image version

Set the image tag in the root `.env`:

```dotenv
EXCALIDASH_TAG=latest
```

Pull and start both images:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Pin a release for repeatable deployments. Use the same version for both images.

## Configure HTTPS

Route HTTPS traffic to container port `80` or `8080`, or host port `6767`. Both container ports serve the same application. Existing `6767:80` mappings and reverse proxies targeting port `80` remain supported. The frontend proxies API and real-time traffic to the backend.

Create `compose.override.yml` with your public origin and the number of trusted proxy hops:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: https://excalidash.alpacawebservices.com
      TRUST_PROXY: "1"
```

Replace `https://excalidash.alpacawebservices.com` with your URL. The hop count must match your proxy chain and your proxies must replace untrusted forwarding headers and forward WebSocket upgrades for `/socket.io/`.

Apply the override:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f compose.override.yml up -d
```

## Non-root port binding

The frontend runs as the non-root nginx user. Modern Docker permits it to bind port `80` inside its network namespace. On Docker installations that restrict low ports, add this frontend override to allow the listener without running nginx as root:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    sysctls:
      net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start: "0"
```

This setting applies to the container network namespace, not the host.

## Persist and back up data

The `backend-data` volume holds SQLite data, image records, and generated signing secrets. Scheduled backups copy the SQLite database. Please save your signing secrets separately.

Add these entries to `compose.override.yml` to enable daily database backups at 04:00 in the container's timezone:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    environment:
      BACKUP_SCHEDULE: "0 0 4 * * *"
      BACKUP_DIR: /app/backups
      BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS: "14"
    volumes:
      - backup-data:/app/backups
volumes:
  backup-data:
```

Initialize the backup volume for the backend's user (UID 1001), then apply the override:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f compose.override.yml run --rm --no-deps --user 0 --entrypoint sh backend -c 'chown 1001:1001 /app/backups'
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f compose.override.yml up -d
```

Check the backend logs for backup errors and test restoring a backup. For PostgreSQL, use your database's backup tools. If you use S3, back up its objects too.

## Upgrade

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
